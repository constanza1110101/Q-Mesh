Q-Mesh
A distributed quantum random number generator network providing high-entropy seeds across enterprise systems.

Overview
Q-Mesh creates a resilient mesh network of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) that work together to distribute high-quality entropy throughout your infrastructure. By leveraging quantum physics for true randomness, Q-Mesh ensures your cryptographic operations have the strongest possible foundation.

Features
Distributed QRNG network architecture
High-throughput entropy distribution
Fault-tolerant design with automatic failover
EntropyWave technology integration
Real-time entropy quality monitoring
Flexible API for integration with existing systems
Support for multiple quantum entropy sources
Requirements
Go 1.20 or higher
EntropyWave QRNG device or compatible hardware
Network connectivity between nodes
Installation
bash

Hide
git clone https://github.com/constanza/q-mesh.git
cd q-mesh
go build
Quick Start
Configure your EntropyWave devices
Edit the config.yaml file with your network topology
Start the primary node:
plaintext

Hide
./qmesh --primary --config config.yaml
Start secondary nodes:
plaintext

Hide
./qmesh --config config.yaml
API Usage
go

Hide
// Initialize a new Q-Mesh node
node, err := qmesh.NewQMeshNode("node-1", "/dev/entropywave0")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Add neighboring nodes
node.AddNeighbor("node-2")
node.AddNeighbor("node-3")

// Distribute entropy to all neighbors
entropy, err := node.DistributeEntropy(32)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
Security Considerations
Physical security of QRNG devices is essential
Network connections should be encrypted
Regular entropy quality testing is recommended
Monitor for quantum side-channel attacks
